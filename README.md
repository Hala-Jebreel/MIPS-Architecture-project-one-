##  Project Objective

Write an assembly program that:
- Reads health test records from a file
- Parses patient ID, test type, date, and value
- Filters or analyzes data based on:
  - Patient ID
  - Test type (e.g., Hgb, LDL, BGT, BPT)
  - Year range
- Performs calculations (e.g., min, max, average)
